description: Ground-truth CSS/layout workflow using the bettercss MCP tools (mcp__bettercss__*) or CLI. Use whenever working on CSS, layout, styling, responsive design, or visual bugs in a web project with a reachable page (dev server or file over HTTP) — diagnosing why an element renders wrong, making CSS changes safely, or verifying frontend work before calling it done. Triggers: "fix this layout", "why is this element X wide", "the sidebar/nav/card looks wrong", "make it responsive", editing any .css/.scss/tailwind classes, or declaring CSS work complete.

# bettercss: CSS ground truth for agents

bettercss extracts the browser's ACTUAL rendered layout as deterministic text.
Six inspection tools + one composite verdict, as MCP tools (`mcp__bettercss__*`)
or the `bettercss` CLI.

## The one hard rule

Never claim anything about what renders without reading it from bettercss.
No guessing from source, no "this should now be centered". Diagnose with the
tool, edit the source, re-verify with the tool.

## Workflow

**1. Before touching any CSS on a working page — lock the good state:**
`snapshot` with a `name` and an ABSOLUTE `dir` (e.g. `<project>/.bettercss`).
Relative dirs resolve against the MCP server's cwd, not the project. For
responsive work snapshot with `viewports` so diffs exist per breakpoint.

**2. Diagnose (in this order):**
- `layout` — the whole rendered tree: positions `(x,y WxH)`, flex/grid facts,
  inline `⚠` warnings. Scope with `selector`/`depth` on big pages.
- `inspect` — one element in depth: box model, non-default styles, stacking
  context, why it has its width/height.
- `explain` — REQUIRED before editing any rule you didn't write: which
  declaration wins (file:line, source-mapped), which lost and why, and what
  layout constraint overrides the declared value (flex-basis, min/max, grid).
  Fix the rule explain names — not the first plausible one in the source.

**3. After every edit:** `diff` against your snapshot. It reports exact moves/
resizes in px. `(no layout changes)` + your intended change = success. Unrelated
movement = your edit had side effects; explain them before proceeding.

**4. Before declaring CSS work done — the gate:**
`verify` (one call). Defaults to the 375x800/768x800/1280x800 sweep; pass
`name`+`dir` to include snapshot diffs. First output line is `VERDICT: PASS`
or `VERDICT: FAIL (...)`. Do not report CSS work complete on a FAIL.
For interactive elements also run with `hover`/`focus` (states apply to the
invariant check; snapshot diffs always compare the resting layout).

## Interaction states

`hover` / `focus` / `active` params (a CSS selector each) force pseudo-state
without a mouse — works on layout/check/inspect/explain/verify, and combines
with `viewports` (hover effects often fit at desktop but bleed at mobile).

## Reading violations

`check`/`verify` violations are tuned to be real bugs: viewport overflow,
visible parent bleed, clipped text, un-layered overlap, zero-size/tiny tap
targets — each with exact px and a `suspect: <rule> @ file:line`. For a
genuinely intentional pattern (animated counters, marquees), add
`data-bettercss-ignore` to that element rather than arguing with the check.

## Chrome

Tools attach to Chrome at port 9222 if running (`--remote-debugging-port=9222`
for logged-in/app-state pages), else launch their own headless Chrome.
